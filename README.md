# Gamma-Ray-Bursts-Closure-Relationships
Mathematica Code to analyze Closure Relationships of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRBs) for the ones detected by Fermi-LAT, Swift XRT, and in the Optical Wavelength. 

# Requirements
Mathematica (version 13.0 or higher) should be installed on your system.

# Data Collection websites of GRBs you want to analyze 

https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ (For Fermi-LAT data)
https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_spectra/00556753 (For data about GRBs detected by SWIFT XRT)



# Usage
Ensure that you have Mathematica software installed on your system.

Open Mathematica and load the necessary code files using the File -> Open option.

Execute the code cells in the data_processing.nb file to process and clean the raw GRB data obtained from Fermi-LAT, Swift XRT, and optical observations.

Execute the code cells in the FermiLAT CRs New Sample (with/without injection).nb file to calculate and analyze the closure relationships for GRBs. Modify the code to focus on specific closure relationships or customize the analysis.

Execute the code cells in the files to visualize GRBs' closure relationships and associated properties. Modify the code to create different plots and visualizations based on your analysis requirements.

Explore and modify the code to suit your research questions and datasets. Refer to the Mathematica documentation for detailed explanations of the functions used in the code.
